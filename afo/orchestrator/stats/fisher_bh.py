"""Fisher's exact test + Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction.

Gap #1 — correct_pvalues() is a hard, PR-blocking requirement.
Every raw p-value from the sweep MUST pass through this function
before any combo is flagged.  The BH-adjusted p-value (not the raw p-value)
is what gets written to finding.fdr_adjusted_p.

Why Fisher's exact vs. chi-square?
  Fisher's exact computes the exact probability of the observed 2×2
  contingency table under the null hypothesis.  With per-combo sample
  sizes in the tens, the chi-square large-sample approximation can be
  unreliable — Fisher's exact stays valid regardless of cell counts.

Why BH-FDR vs. Bonferroni?
  Bonferroni controls the probability of *any* false positive (FWER),
  growing more conservative as the number of combos grows.  BH controls
  the *expected proportion* of false positives among flagged findings (FDR)
  — less conservative, so across dozens of combo sweeps it catches real
  drift that Bonferroni would wash out, at the cost of a controlled
  false-discovery rate rather than zero false-positive tolerance.
